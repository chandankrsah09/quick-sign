Hereâ€™s a brief description for your signature app:

"This Signature App allows users to create, customize, and capture their digital signatures easily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With a simple and intuitive interface, users can draw signatures on a canvas, clear or reset them, and save them for future use. Ideal for form submissions, contracts, and other online documents requiring personal authentication."

You can modify the description based on the specific features you add to your app!
